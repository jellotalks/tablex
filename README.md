# tablex

This is a simple Python tool that will import a table from a website and export it to xlsx.

## Set up
1) Pull the tablex.py file into your local directory
2) run `python tablex.py` or `python3 tablex.py` to run the file
3) Alternatively, import the tablex directly by adding `import tablex` when tablex is in your local directory, or added to your python path
